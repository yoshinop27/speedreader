# Speed Reader
### Meryem, Preston, Z
*This speed-reading program uses the RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) technique which we use with a small corpus of excerpts to run small user tests on effectiveness. Completed as a [CSC-207 assignment](osera.cs.grinnell.edu/ttap/data-structures-labs/speed-reader.html).*

## Analysis of Results
Our participants demonstrated that they were able to comprehend what they were reading with our speed reader. They answered around 80% of questions correctly at 250 and 350 WPM, as well as in the control condition where they read the text from a regular text file. This indicates that their comprehension was similar whether they were using the speed reader or not. However, after the reading speed exceeds a certain point, comprehension decreased, with participants answering only about 20% of questions correctly at 500 WPM.
